# staircase-lights

Original project by @snikogos https://www.instructables.com/LED-Stair-Lighting/
Further adapted for nodeMCU by @daromer2 https://github.com/daromer2/StairLights

The code base is heavily modified. Code and variables have been cleaned.

For my use case, the project allows for:
- MQTT commands to set fixed lighting effects
- OTA updates
